# RarFile - introduction

RAR is a proprietary archive file format. [Read more about it at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rar). The compression algorithm is proprietary but the decompression can be found in unrar's source code. There is basically three versions of the format:

- RAR (Wikipedia says 1993 for format, WinRAR was released 1995)
- RAR2, used since version 1.50 (WinRAR 2 was released 1996)
- RAR3, used since 2.9 and by 3.0

WinRAR is the trialware graphical program, RAR is the shareware command-line program and unrar is the freeware command-line program with available source code. RAR and unrar can be found at http://www.rarlab.com/rar_add.htm.


## Goals

This code targets the RAR2 version of the format. The code supports split archives but not compressed or encrypted archives. Only the "store" method for compression is supported. A lot of other features of the format won't be implemented. The purpose is to be able to open the kind of rar-files that are common for [scene releases in filesharing networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_(warez\)). The goals:

- to be able to open rar-files in version 2 format
- won't ever modify or create archives
- not encrypted or compressed
- possibly split into multiple archives
- CRC checks won't be performed, the archive will be assumed to be fully   downloaded and OK
- file attributes won't have any effect
- comments will be ignored
- uses new or old file naming
- be able to list files and read their contents
- possibly handle directories (unsure about this)


## Examples

RarFile is minimal, has no dependencies and is platform-independent. It's implemented in the Ruby language. Look at the doc comments and regular comments for a detailed description of the format, features etc.

Do a quick check:

	RarFile.is_rar_file?(filename) # => true / false

Opening and reading:

	# Alias of #new. Works like File.open - can take a block, after which the file will be closed
	RarFile.open(filename) do |rar|
	  archived_files = rar.filenames # => ["file.txt", "another_file.txt"]
	  rar.filesize(archived_files.first) # => 1234
	  rar.read(archived_files.first) # => "Hello world!"
	end
	
	RarFile.new(not_a_rar_file) # will raise RarFile::NotARarFile < IOError

Inspecting:

	# Inspecting a RarFile-object will show more info about the archive
	
	require 'pp'
	RarFile.open(filename) do |rar|
	  rar.filenames # The object won't contain any data until a method has been called
	  pp rar
	end


## Resources used for writing this code

- Implementation ideas was taken from http://github.com/jphastings/unrar
- some simple, minimal Python code that can be found at   http://trac.opensubtitles.org/projects/opensubtitles/wiki/RarSourceCodes or https://bugs.launchpad.net/subdownloader/+bug/242696
- a document named [RAR version 2.02 - Technical information](http://libxad.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/libxad/support/formats/RAR202.txt?revision=1.1&view=markup), that has been a tremendous help for understanding the format. Don't know the origins of the document.
- Most projects that extract rar-files use unrar. The code is in C++. From the readme: "source is subset of RAR and generated from RAR source automatically". It supports all 3 format versions and has a lot of other features which makes it a bit hard to read the code.
  - `headers.hpp`: is a good starting point. It has some constants and data structs for the file format's different "blocks" and "headers".
  - `arcread.cpp`, `archive.[ch]pp`: reads in bits from files and puts them in the block/header data structs.
  - `extract.[ch]pp`: when run from command-line `CmdExtract` will extract the file
  - `volume.cpp`: `MergeArchive` for opening split archives (I think)
  - `list.cpp`: prints info for archive, file headers etc
- http://www.unrarlib.org which can decompress the RAR2-format and is GPL. It's code is in C.
- http://hem.bredband.net/catacombae/jlrarx.html, a Java library which uses unrarlib as reference. GPL and pretty messy, but good anyway.

I've also used the calculator (programmer mode) and the hex editor [HexFiend.app](http://ridiculousfish.com/hexfiend/) for calculating and checking flags, bits, fields etc.
